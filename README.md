## 🧠 Strategic Insight Extracted

> During **January and February**, interest in oat milk is consistently high. However, in **November and December**, interest drops significantly. This pattern suggests that consumers start the year motivated by goals of lifestyle and dietary changes (“new year, new me”), but tend to lose momentum by the end of the year — reinforcing a common behavioral cycle.
